## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
   - Terraform >= 1.0.0
   - Python >= 3.8
   - Docker installed and configured
   - AWS key pair named 'hpc-drug-discovery-key' in your AWS region
   ```

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darlingoscanoa/aws-hpc-architecture-drug-discovery.git
   cd aws-hpc-architecture-drug-discovery
   ```

3. **Build and Push Docker Image**
   ```bash
   # Make the build script executable
   chmod +x scripts/build_and_push.sh
   
   # Build and push the Docker image (replace with your AWS account ID)
   ./scripts/build_and_push.sh YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
   ```

4. **Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your configuration
   ```

5. **Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Create AWS key pair first
   aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name hpc-drug-discovery-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > ~/.ssh/hpc-drug-discovery-key.pem
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/hpc-drug-discovery-key.pem

   # Deploy infrastructure
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply -auto-approve

   # Get head node IP and SSH into it
   HEAD_NODE_IP=$(terraform output -raw head_node_public_ip)
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/hpc-drug-discovery-key.pem ec2-user@$HEAD_NODE_IP
   ```
